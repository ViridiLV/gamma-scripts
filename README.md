For scripts to work need libraries/packages that it uses.

For Ubuntu/Debian systems:
```
apt install flatpak wget tar fq findutils

## Step 1 - getting the scripts

Scripts are maintained in a rolling release manner, meaning you get them straight from the github repo.
Version numbers inside the scripts are informative for troubleshooting logs.

1.1 Open a terminal instance in the main directory where your gamma and anomaly files will be.

1.2. Download and make the script executable:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ViridiLV/gamma-scripts/refs/heads/main/gamma-scripts.sh
```

1.3. Make it executable(optional if you choose to execute from already open terminal)

```
chmod -x gamma-scripts.sh
```
1.4. Run the script
 a) 
 ```
 bash gamma-scripts.sh
 ```
 b) via "Open in  terminal" of your distro's GUI file manager right click/open menu
